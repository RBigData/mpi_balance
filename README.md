# mpi_balance 

A batch MPI example for slurm or PBS scheduler to illustrate balancing
the number of R instances per node and available cores per R
instance. The example combines
[pbdMPI](https://github.com/RBigData/pbdMPI) (from pbdr.org) with
`mclapply()` (from the parallel package).

The example is intended to provide practice and insight into how R
multinode and multicore concepts play out on a cluster. I hope that
understanding these concepts can lead to more efficient use of
parallel resources.

You may need to modify the SLURM or PBS parameter values and possibly
the `module`s that are loaded in the `hello_<machine>_slurm.sh` and
`hello_<machine>_pbs.sh` scripts
to match your local requirements. We
would love to hear from you about your submission scripts on other clusters.

The script expects both files to be in a directory named
`~/mpi_balance`. Typically, this is submitted at the shell prompt on a
cluster login node using slurm (example from ORNL's CADES cluster) by

```{sh}
$ sbatch hello_cades_slurm.sh
```
or on one using PBS (example from IT4I's Karolina cluster) by
```{sh}
$ qsub hello_karolina_pbs.sh 
```

A correct execution produces two output files `balance.e` and
`balance.o`. The `balance.e` is the error output and a correct
execution only gives the loaded modules list. The `balance.o` gives
"Hello" messages from all ranks, specifying node names and process ids
used by `mclapply()` within each rank. The following is the output in
file `balance.o` obtained on one of ORNL's CADES clusters:

The corresponding `balance.e` output is:
```
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:

```

Note that other multithreaded R packages using multiple cores are
managed similarly but each may have its own parameters that specify
the number of cores used. Some may require setting environment
variables.

Care must be taken to prevent oversubscribing available cores and
slowing things down. In particular, multithreaded BLAS (such as
OpenBLAS) may by default use all available cores on a node,
conflicting with other on-node MPI instances or processes forked by
mclapply. See also wrathematics/openblasctl on GitHub for OpenBLAS
thread control from R.

While this script illustrates how to manage availability of cores to
MPI ranks, the actual placement of threads is done by the OS. The OS
does a pretty good job in our experience, although there can be a
difference between theory and reality as is illustrated in this
